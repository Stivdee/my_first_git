#My first project#

In this project I will create a rand message generator. It shall contain 3 different random messages combined into one message. 

##I will use##
I will use JavaScript to completet this task.

I have added random words to the arrays.

I have created a function that will return a number.

I have created a function that will create random sentences. It has a parameter. The parameter will decide how many sentences that will be created and returned.

The sentences works good.
